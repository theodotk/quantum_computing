The Jupyter notebook implements image classification with SVM based on a quantum kernel, based on ZZ feature map. The result of the quantum classification algorithm is slightly worse than of SVMs based on classical kernels, but it was fun to play with different feature maps and learn how they work.

The problem and the data are taken from the [IBM quantum challenge](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-2021): I wanted to refresh my memory with `qiskit`, looked for ML-related problems to solve and stumbled upon it.
